# nand2tetris
A compilation of my nand2tetris projects for CSCE 312.

## Description
Repos beginning with "Chips" contain various electronic circuits built using the nand2tetris HDL. Those beginning with "Prepositions" contain chips designed with the circuits in the corresponding number "Chips" repo.

"Assembler" contains a Hack assembly language assembler written in Python. It reads in the data from a .asm file and translates it into a 16 bit binary string, done according to the [Hack Assembly Language Cheat Sheet](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cyy/courses/introCS/17fall/lectures/handouts/lec08_HackML.pdf).
## Composition
Most of these files are written in the nand2tetris-specific HDL and Hack assembly language, which differs from regular HDLs and assembly languages in that most chips are hard-coded by the authors of the library and the assembly language is a syntactical diversion from conventional assembly language. 

The one exception to this is "Assembler.py" found in the "Assembler" repo, which is written in Python.
